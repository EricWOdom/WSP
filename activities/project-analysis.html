            <h2>Site Intent</h2>
            <p>The main objective of the redesign of Orlando Furniture Direct’s website is to increase page rank amongst search engine result pages (SERPs). Secondary objectives consist of increasing conversions in either a newsletter sign up, or requesting more information for products. Tertiary objectives include optimization of the current responsive design, increased branding, and clean up of HTML and CSS code to meet W3C standards.</p>
            <p>Additionally, we want to heighten the user experience, improve usability, and condense the “fluff” currently employed on OrlandoFurnitureDirect.com.</p>
            <h3>How am I going to accomplish this?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement basic &lt;META&gt; tag information for search engines to crawl. At the moment the only &lt;META&gt; information in use is the Title. I’ll implement page descriptions, and keywords that coordinate with each pages specific content.</li>
                <li>Implement a call to action that pushes users to sign up for a newsletter in exchange for coupons, or to request information. </li>
                <li>Increase branding around website that scales with the increased responsiveness.</li>
                <li>Implement semantic HTML5 coding that validates with the W3C standards.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>Based on my research of the other furniture retailers in the Orlando, FL area, I recommend keeping Orlando Furniture Direct positioned as a “low price wholesaler” that can beat any retail stores prices. Additionally I recommend implementing a personal touch to the website. A quick look at competitors websites show no sign of “locally owned” or any kind of personality. I understand how difficult this can be, so we can work together to come up with some plans to begin personalizing the brand to give online customers a glimpse of who and what they can expect to interact with at the warehouse.</p>
            <h3>Competitors</h3>
            <p>Competitors were chosen based on Google search results for “wholesale furniture in Orlando” and “Orlando furniture.”</p>
